## Next Steps
To use the Footer component in your application:

1. Import the component in your layout:
```typescript
import Footer from '@/components/Footer';
```

2. Add it to your layout (e.g., `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`):
```typescript
<Footer locale={locale} />
```

## Notes
- The Footer component is a client component ('use client') because it uses the useTranslations hook
- All external links (social media) use `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
- Payment method logos are embedded as SVG for better performance and scalability
- The copyright year is dynamically generated using `new Date().getFullYear()`
- Component follows the same styling patterns as the Header component for consistency

## Task Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All requirements met and component ready for integration
